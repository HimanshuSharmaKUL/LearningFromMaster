# Understanding This Line of Code

```python
logits = self.token_embedding_table(idx)
```

---

## 🎯 What’s the Goal?

Understand what this line does when:

- `idx.shape = (4, 8)` — a tensor of token IDs (batch of 4 sequences, each of length 8)
- `self.token_embedding_table = nn.Embedding(65, 65)` — a learnable embedding table

---

## 🧠 What is `nn.Embedding`?

`nn.Embedding(num_embeddings, embedding_dim)` is a lookup table:

- Input: token ID (integer from 0 to 64)
- Output: a learnable vector of length 65

```python
nn.Embedding(65, 65)  # 65 tokens, each mapped to a 65-dimensional vector
```

---

## 🔄 What Happens in `self.token_embedding_table(idx)`?

- `idx` has shape `(4, 8)` → token indices
- Output has shape `(4, 8, 65)` → each token index replaced by its 65-d vector

PyTorch applies the embedding lookup element-wise across the tensor.

## 📦 Visualization

### Input:
```text
idx (4x8):
[[4, 21, 7, 15,  ...],
 [9, 14, 23, 3,  ...],
 ...
]
```

### Embedding Table (65x65):
```text
[
 [0.1, -0.4, ...,  0.6],   ← token 0
 [0.0,  0.2, ..., -0.9],   ← token 1
 ...
]
```

### Output:
```text
logits = embedding_table[idx] → shape (4, 8, 65)
```

## 📈 Why Are They Called “Logits”?

Each 65-dimensional output vector at `(b, t)` represents:

> “Given token `idx[b, t]`, here are scores for what the **next token** might be.”

These are **raw scores** (logits), not probabilities. You apply softmax during training or inference to get probabilities.

## ✅ Summary Table

| Concept | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `idx.shape` | `(4, 8)` — token IDs |
| `token_embedding_table` | `nn.Embedding(65, 65)` — lookup table |
| Output shape | `(4, 8, 65)` — each token mapped to 65-d logits |
| Why "logits"? | They’re used to predict the next token (via softmax + cross-entropy) |
